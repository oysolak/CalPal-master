CalPal - Calorie Tracker App
CalPal is a Calorie Tracker App designed to help users manage their calorie intake. 

Users can:
Select foods from a database and add them to their meals.
Add new foods to the database using Firebase Realtime Database.
Set a target calorie goal and compare it with their total calorie consumption.
The app is built using Android Studio and integrates Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval.

Setup Instructions
Clone or download the project repository.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Ensure you have API Level 35 (Medium Phone) installed in your SDK. That's what we used on our tests.
If you encounter an issue with the local.properties file:
Open the file and replace the directory path with your username to fix build errors.

We always worked together in the same room, so we didn't precisely split the workload. We always worked on each other's computers as well. So there are no clear lines between our contributions.
UI design is our shared work.
